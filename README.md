# k8s-supervisor-install
Provides init script and ansible workaround for DNS files and services on openstack created cluster
# This is developement !!! Use at your own risk ;)

added some command files to ease the work with docker on master node
- karmada.sh
- sarmada.sh
Each of these scripts as the name suppose is for killing armada docker or starting armada docker container.

TODO - finish work on modulated scripts for master and supervisor. Trying to simplify and divide commands for both of nodes. Just to make things cleaner.
